## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I practiced HTML5 semantics.

- I also practiced responsive design using css media query.

- Also, I got better at arranging & organizing my code, making use of comments for each section that I am working with in order to stay organized and on track.

- Naming classes was poor. Although they make some kind of sense to me. They may not make much for others. I named it that way based on my understanding and interpretation of the design.

- There were several repititons of property in several classes across , Code refactoring & DRY principle is one major area of improvement .

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
/* media queries */
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    .container{
        margin: 0;
        width: 100%;
    }

    .content{
        margin: 0 14px;
    }

  .nutrition td {
    /* padding-right: 80px; */
    padding-right: 70px;
  }

  header h1{
    line-height: 1.2;
    font-size: 30px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
